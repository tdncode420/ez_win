'''Windows OS Python API

    An API providing numerous methods 

    This is nothing more than a wrapper around the pywin32 library modules (win32api, win32gui, etc...) simplifying the sometimes complicated tasks of creating/handling/manipulating the running process'/threads (PID/TID) and window handles (HWND) within the current environment (along with a handle full of miscellaneous Windows OS specific methods such as 'findFile', 'findDir', ...)
